# GeoTale

## General Info
NOTE: Our program requires our AWS server to be up and running for proper functionality. Please contact @Gr8Dan to organize
a testing period.

GeoTale is a simple audio file sharing program that allows users to upload and download short audio files. Its intention
is to be a story-sharing app allows users to share stories based on geolocation (based on zip code). Stories and
properties are stored on an AWS-hosted server. Story properties (zip code, author, title, description, length) are 
stored in a SQL server. Users are to be able to upload a file, see what files are on the server, and download files to play them
on their local machine.

## Areas for feedback:

1. The GUI: Is the GUI easy to navigate? How else should the GUI be improved?
2. Readability: Is the program easy to use and intuitive? Is its purpose clearly communicated?
3. Functional requirements: Is what is displayed to the user (file length, description, etc.) not enough, too much, or
   just enough information? Should some properties be hidden? What else would help for a user to be able to use
   the program?
